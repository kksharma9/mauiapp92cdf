Eparcha: Privacy policy
Welcome to the eparcha app for Android!

This is Android app developed by KK Sharma. The app is available on Indus AppStore.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable 
information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, 
and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. except user name, password, first name , lastname
which are stored by firebase authentication. which are also deleted by us on time to time for those users not using the 
app frequently.

Explanation of permissions requested in the app
The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the AndroidManifest.xml file:

Internet and network permission is used for working the app


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, 
or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, 
please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
KK Sharma
India.
